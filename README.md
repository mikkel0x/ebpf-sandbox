# eBPF Lab Script

Hi! Most of this script is a total rip from multiple different sites but I needed it for a few things and was tired of recreating my environment each time.  It is buggy but I've decided to leave it that way to prevent any "oopsies." 

This install will....Install Docker, Kubernetes, Kind, Helm, and Cilium Tetragon. From there, head over to https://isovalent.com/labs and you'll be able to get to the point where you'll run an unauthorized shell within a k8s cluster. The rest is in the labs. Have fun!
